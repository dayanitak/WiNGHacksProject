	Now where the hell am I? And why do I feel so... small?

	- No! 	=> End
	- Hello! I'm Nova!
		Rey: Nice to meet you, Nova. The name is Rey. I saw you land just now! What brought you here?
		- Yeah, I'm on my journey to find whatever I was meant to look for. Where am I right now?
		- Yeah... well I don't know yet. Where am I?
		Rey: Oh okay, that's cool! Well you're at Mervoi, home of the little and big dreams! Welcome!
		Oh okay, thank you. Also another question, why do I feel so small?
		Rey: Well, that's because you are. It just happens automatically when people come to our world. Why you ask? I don't know, I don't make up the rules! HAHAHA
		- Oh haha okay, hopefully it won't be temporary. Might as well accept it.
		- Sigh, I guess I can't do anything about it now.
		Rey: Well you adapt rather quickly. Anyways, since you're here, I'm going to give you a quest.. and you can't say no.
		- What? What happened to my opinion of saying no-
		Rey: I veto. Please go see the Queen Bee! Make haste now, come back to me once you do.

	Rey: You've done me a great service. I hope you found what you've been looking for.
	- Yeah, I think I finally know what it is. Thanks! And goodbye!
	- Even though it was a long quest, it did help me. Goodbye then!
	Rey: Alright then, goodbye!
